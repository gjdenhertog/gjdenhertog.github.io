Again you ask? Yes, due to a server crash all of my old blog posts are lost resulting in a fresh start. Fortunately this gave me the opportunity to rebuild the blog entirely. What you see now is hosted on Github and build with Jekyll (my old blog used Wordpress). Jekyll makes it easier for me to maintain the website (I am a developer after all) and the website is crazy fast; seems like a win-win!
